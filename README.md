My personal vim config in a repo to easily share it among devices.

Clone this repo to .vim in your homedir, and link the vimrc in this repo to .vimrc in your home-dir.

Make /home/.../.vim/scripts/php_ctags.sh executable and add /home/.../.vim/scripts to the path (.bashrc PATH=$PATH:/home/.../.vim/scripts).
